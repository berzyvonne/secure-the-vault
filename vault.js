// Pseudocode:
// 1. Create a string with directions to unlock the vault.
// 2. Create three arithmetic operators, each equalling one of the three numbers in the combination.
//   -- const num1 = 5 * 2;  const num2 = 50 - 10; const num3 = 30 + 9
// 3. Create a pop-up dialog to display the directions and each number of the vault combination using alert().
// 4. Add comments throughout the code to explain my steps.
// 5. Commit to GitHub.


// Directions to unlock the vault
const str1 = "You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:";

// Number 1 of the combination
const num1 = 5*2;

// Number 2 of the combination

// Number 3 of the combination
const num3 = 30+9;


// Alerts for the above
